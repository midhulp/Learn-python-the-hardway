#using comment to disable code

# A comment, this is commented so you can read your program later.
 # Anything after the '#' is ignored by python.

print("I could have coded like this.") # and the comment after is ignored

 # You can also use a comment to "disable" a code:
 # print("This won't run.")
print("This will run.")
